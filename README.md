 ##Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis – Age-wise Population Distribution of India (2022)

###📌 Task1 Summary:

This task involves analyzing the population of India based on different age groups.
We studied the percentage distribution of each age group and visualized it using a clean and informative bar chart.

### 📈 Work Done:
Defined age groups (0-14, 15-24, 25-54, 55-64, 65+)

Assigned population percentage to each group

Created a bar chart using Python and Matplotlib

Added percentage labels on top of each bar for better readability

Tools Used:

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Matplotlib


🔍 Key Insights:

The largest portion of the population is in the 25–54 age group (41%)

The 0–14 age group also has a significant share (25%)

The population of people aged 65 and above is relatively low (8%)
